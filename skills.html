        <h3>Reflection on Skills Audit Results</h3>
        <p>I really enjoyed doing the Career Smart Skills Audit! It was so interesting to see which areas I need to focus on for my personal and professional growth. The skills that really stood out for me were managing others, commercial awareness, numerical skills and team working. I feel like these are super important for moving forward in my career!</p>

        <p>I really connected with the emphasis on managing others. I think it's so important to lead by example, manage performance and build teams in order to inspire and achieve collective success. It's also super important to develop your commercial awareness! This helps you understand business dynamics, stay up to date with competitors and contribute to your organisation's goals in a meaningful way.</p>

        <p>I'd also love to brush up on my numerical skills! I'm especially keen to get better at accurately presenting data, interpreting charts and performing calculations – all super important for my data science journey. Last but not least, I'll be working on my team-working abilities, including collaboration, coordination, and fostering others' contributions. This will help me to thrive in dynamic, team-oriented environments.</p>

        <p>These results have helped me identify concrete steps to enhance my skill set. Moving forward, I'll be seeking targeted resources and opportunities to build these capabilities, ensuring my growth aligns with both personal aspirations and professional demands.</p>
